    <string name="advise2">What Are the Stages of Sleep?</string>
    <string name="advise3">REM SLEEP</string>
    <string name="advise4">Advices for fall asleep quickly</string>
    <string name="advise5">Breathing rhythm</string>
    <string name="advise6">Heart Rate</string>

    <string name="advise1Info">\t\tA sleep cycle refers to the period of time it takes for an individual to progress through the stages of sleep outlined above. One does not go straight from deep sleep to REM sleep, however. Rather, a sleep cycle progress through the stages of non-REM sleep from light to deep sleep, then reverse back from deep sleep to light sleep, ending with time in REM sleep before starting over in light sleep again. After REM sleep, the individual returns to stage 1 of light sleep and begins a new cycle. As the night progresses, individuals spend increasingly more time in REM sleep and correspondingly less time in deep sleep. The first sleep cycle takes about 90 minutes. After that, they average between 100 to 120 minutes. Typically, an individual will go through four to five sleep cycles a night.\n\t\tUsually sleepers pass through five stages: 1, 2, 3, 4 and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. These stages progress cyclically from 1 through REM then begin again with stage 1. A complete sleep cycle takes an average of 90 to 110 minutes, with each stage lasting between 5 to 15 minutes. The first sleep cycles each night have relatively short REM sleeps and long periods of deep sleep but later in the night, REM periods lengthen and deep sleep time decreases.</string>
    <string name="advise3Info">\t\tDuring REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, brain waves mimic activity during the waking state. The eyes remain closed but move rapidly from side-to-side, perhaps related to the intense dream and brain activity that occurs during this stage.\n\n\t\tNational Sleep Foundation’s Sleep Duration Recommendations:</string>
    <string name="advise6Info">\t\tA normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.\n\t\tGenerally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats per minute.\n\t\tTo measure your heart rate, simply check your pulse. Place your index and third fingers on your neck to the side of your windpipe. To check your pulse at your wrist, place two fingers between the bone and the tendon over your radial artery — which is located on the thumb side of your wrist.\n\t\tWhen you feel your pulse, count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiply this number by four to calculate your beats per minute.\n\n\t\tKeep in mind that many factors can influence heart rate, including:\n\t\t•	Age\n\t\t•	Fitness and activity levels\n\t\t•	Being a smoker\n\t\t•	Having cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol or diabetes\n\t\t•	Air temperature\n\t\t•	Body position (standing up or lying down, for example)\n\t\t•	Emotions\n\t\t•	Body size\n\t\t•	Medications\n\n\t\tAlthough there is a wide range of normal, an unusually high or low heart rate may indicate an underlying problem. Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you are not a trained athlete and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) — especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.</string>

    <string name="sleepState">\t\tThere are five stages of sleep. Stages 1-4 are non-REM sleep, followed by REM sleep.</string>
    <string name="state1">STAGE 1</string>
    <string name="state2">STAGE 2</string>
    <string name="state3">STAGE 3</string>
    <string name="state4">STAGE 4</string>

    <string name="state1Info">\t\tStage 1 is light sleep where you drift in and out of sleep and can be awakened easily. In this stage, the eyes move slowly and muscle activity slows. During this stage, many people experience sudden muscle contractions preceded by a sensation of falling.</string>
    <string name="state2Info">\t\tIn stage 2, eye movement stops and brain waves become slower with only an occasional burst of rapid brain waves. The body begins to prepare for deep sleep, as the body temperature begins to drop and the heart rates slows.</string>
    <string name="state3Info">\t\tWhen a person enters stage 3, extremely slow brain waves called delta waves are interspersed with smaller, faster waves. This is deep sleep. It is during this stage that a person may experience sleepwalking, night terrors, talking during one’s sleep, and bedwetting. These behaviors are known as parasomnias, and tend to occur during the transitions between non-REM and REM sleep.</string>
    <string name="state4Info">\t\tIn stage 4, deep sleep continues as the brain produces delta waves almost exclusively. People roused from this state feel disoriented for a few minutes.</string>

    <string name="toSleep1">1.Practice progressive relaxation</string>
    <string name="toSleep2">2.Listen to music</string>
    <string name="toSleep3">3.Limit Caffeine and Drink a Soothing Beverage</string>
    <string name="toSleep4">4.Take a warm shower before bed</string>
    <string name="toSleep5">5.Turn Off All Electronics</string>

    <string name="toSleep1Info">\t\tRecommended by the National Sleep Foundation as a way to fall asleep fast, progressive muscle relaxation involves slowly tensing and then relaxing each muscle in your body to help your body relax. The Mayo Clinic describes the technique as follows:\n\t\tStart by tensing and relaxing the muscles in your toes and progressively working your way up to your neck and head. You can also start with your head and neck and work down to your toes. Tense your muscles for at least five seconds and then relax for 30 seconds, and repeat.\n\t\t“I encourage patients to try progressive relaxation,” says Meltzer. “It’s not enough by itself, but in combination with other things, it definitely makes a huge difference.”</string>
    <string name="toSleep2Info">\t\tStudies have shown that classical music, or any music that has a slow rhythm of 60 to 80 beats per minute, can help lull you to sleep. In a 2008 study, students aged 19 to 28 who listened to relaxing classical music for 45 minutes before bed showed significant improvement in sleep quality. Bonus: They also reported decreased symptoms of depression.</string>
    <string name="toSleep3Info">\t\tCaffeine is widely used among people to fight fatigue and stimulate alertness. It can be found in foods and beverages like chocolate, coffee, sodas and energy drinks.\n\t\tUnfortunately, caffeine can have disastrous effects on your sleep.\n\t\tAlthough the effects of caffeine vary from person to person, it is recommended that you refrain from consuming caffeine at least six hours before bedtime.\n\t\tInstead, you could drink a soothing tea like chamomile tea, which has been shown to promote sleep and relaxation.</string>
    <string name="toSleep4Info">\t\tWarming your body up with a hot shower an hour before bed and then stepping into cooler air will cause your body temperature to drop more precipitously. Studies show that this rapid temperature decrease slows your metabolism faster and prepares your body for sleep. “Showers can also be very relaxing, so that helps, too,” says Meltzer. If you shower every night around the same time, making it part of a consistent bedtime routine, you’ll see the most sleep value from it, she adds. “Then your body has an expectation of what’s coming next.”</string>
    <string name="toSleep5Info">\t\tUsing electronic devices late at night is terrible for sleep.\n\t\tWatching TV, playing video games, using a mobile phone and social networking can make it significantly harder for you to fall and stay asleep.\n\t\tIt is recommended that you disconnect all electronics and put away computers and mobile phones so you can ensure a quiet place, free of distractions. You will be able to fall asleep much faster.</string>

    <string name="breathMsg">\t\tThere is a general perception amongst clinicians that ‘normal’ breathing is steady and regular, while ‘abnormal’ breathing is irregular and more variable. There are specific well-known rhythms such as Cheyne-Stokes breathing that support this view. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is a distinctive pattern often seen in patients with end stage heart failure, characterised by periods of rapid breathing, followed by intermittent periods of not breathing (known as apnoea).</string>
    <string name="breathPro1">1.Tachypnea</string>
    <string name="breathPro2">2.Bradypnea</string>

    <string name="breathPro1Info">\t\tTachypnea or tachypnoea is abnormally rapid breathing.\n\t\tIn adult humans at rest, any respiratory rate between 12 and 20 breaths per minute is normal and tachypnea is indicated by a rate greater than 20 breaths per minute.</string>
    <string name="breathPro2Info">\t\tBradypnea or bradypnoea is abnormally slow breathing. The respiratory rate at which bradypnea is diagnosed depends on the age of the patient.\n\n\t\tAge ranges\n\n\t\tAge 0–1 year &lt; 30 breaths per minute\n\t\tAge 1–3 years &lt; 25 breaths per minute\n\t\tAge 3–12 years &lt; 20 breaths per minute\n\t\tAge 12–50 years &lt; 12 breaths per minute\n\t\tAge 50 and up &lt; 13 breaths per minute\n\n\t\tSymptoms\n\n\t\t•	Dizziness\n\t\t•	Near-fainting or fainting\n\t\t•	Fatigue\n\t\t•	Weakness\n\t\t•	Chest pains\n\t\t•	Shortness of breath\n\t\t•	Memory impairment or confusion\n\t\t•	Tiring easily during any physical activity</string>
